    <h1 id="intro">Intro</h1>
<p>I&rsquo;m a computer engineer and since the earlier days I have been developing software for embedded systems, mobile phones and computers. Also, I have already developed my own circuit boards!</p>
<p>During this 15+ years I had the oportunity to work with very smart people on several areas. Since
developing SCADA applications (mostly in C/C++) for Siemens PTD (MN) to developing embedded systems for train control (C/Lua) for ART.</p>
<p>In the past three years I shifted my carreer towards backend development for Linux and so I got into sysadmin/cloud roles and I had the chance to work with Google Cloud Platform and its services.</p>
<p>This provided me the chance to work close to developers that created both frontend and backend applications with C#, Rust, Python, PHP, JavaScript, Node.js. Then I had the opportunity to develop myself as a software engineer with focus on cloud, bringing automation, quality and better product release through the use of CICD and Dev + Ops best practices.</p>

<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>To keep myself updated I constantly keep studying new technologies, I like to read a lot (books, articles, blog posts, papers), I go through courses on Linux Academy, Coursera and Udemy and I enjoy a lot to create my own experiments.</p>
<p>Nowadays, my objectives are to provide the best solutions through the use of software automation for the stakeholders, be it a developer, a team, a sysadmin, a product owner or a CTO.</p>
<p>Finally, I love to work with automation of repetitive tasks by coding in Bash or Python or Go. I enjoy working with Linux, cloud infrastructure and I&rsquo;m planning to get certified in CKA.</p>
